# My Neovim configuration

Key points:

- written in Lua.
- vim-plug as plugin manager. lazy.nvim is too complex.
- mason as language server manager
- uses neovim lsp builtin feature, no plugin needed since release 0.11
- some Symfony specific features (WIP)

Prerequisite:

    - git
    - bat
    - ripgrep
    - fdfind
    - install Neovim with [prebuilt archives](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#pre-built-archives-2)

TODO:

    - extract Symfony plugin to its own repo, when it's ready
